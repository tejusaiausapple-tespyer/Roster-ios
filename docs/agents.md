## What This App Does

RosterStaff is a staff rostering and scheduling app for a single business (Sura Investments Pty Ltd). It has two user roles:

1. **Staff** — View assigned shifts, submit worked hours (timesheets), manage weekly availability, complete assigned tasks with photo proof, view messages/notifications.
2. **Manager** — Create/edit/publish shifts, approve/reject timesheets, view dashboard metrics, manage the roster across all staff.

Both roles share a single codebase. The app routes to the correct UI based on `AppUser.role` after login.

| `App/RosterStaffApp.swift` | `@main` entry point, configures Firebase, injects `RosterRepository` + `AuthViewModel` |
| `App/AppDelegate.swift` | UIKit app delegate for push notification registration |
| `App/RootView.swift` | Auth state router — shows Login, DeviceAuth gate, ProfileCompletion, or main content based on auth state |

### Models (all in `Models/`)
| File | Key Types |
|------|-----------|
| `User.swift` | `AppUser` — full user profile with role, status, availability, employment type |
| `Shift.swift` | `Shift` — rostered shift with date, times, break, location, status |
| `Timesheet.swift` | `Timesheet` — submitted hours linked to a shift |
| `Availability.swift` | `DayAvailability`, `Weekday`, `UserAvailability` — weekly availability pattern |
| `Message.swift` | `Message` — manager-to-staff notification messages |
| `RosterTask.swift` | `RosterTask`, `TaskCompletion` — recurring/one-off tasks with completion tracking |

| `RosterFormat.swift` | Formatting helpers for dates, times, hours display |
| `FirestoreValue.swift` | `FS` enum — safe Firestore document field extraction |
| `AppSettings.swift` | `AppSettings` — company name from Firestore |

### Services (all in `Services/`)
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `RosterRepository.swift` | **Core data layer** — Firestore real-time listeners, all CRUD operations, @Observable for SwiftUI |
| `AuthService.swift` | Firebase Auth wrapper (sign in/out, password reset, change password) |
| `WorkerAPIClient.swift` | Cloudflare Worker API calls (save availability, complete password change, send notifications) |
| `DeviceAuthService.swift` | Biometric/passcode local authentication gate |
| `BiometricCredentialStore.swift` | Stores login credentials behind biometric protection |

### ViewModels
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AuthViewModel.swift` | Login/logout state machine, biometric quick-login, handles auth flow |
| `AppRouter.swift` | Navigation state for programmatic routing |

---

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. `RosterStaffApp` configures Firebase and creates `AuthViewModel` + `RosterRepository`
2. `RootView` observes `AuthViewModel.state` (enum: `.loading`, `.unauthenticated`, `.authenticated`)
3. On successful login → `RosterRepository.start(uid:)` begins Firestore listeners
4. Role-based routing: `AppUser.role == .manager` → `ManagerMainView`, else → `MainTabView`
5. Optional gates: `DeviceAuthGateView` (biometric), `ProfileCompletionView` (missing profile data), `ChangePasswordView` (forced)

### Data Layer (RosterRepository)
- **Pattern**: `@MainActor @Observable` class injected via SwiftUI `.environment()`
- **Listeners**: Real-time Firestore `onSnapshot` for shifts, timesheets, messages, tasks, task completions, user profile, app settings
- **Role Awareness**: Manager gets all-staff data (shifts windowed to the ±shift window, timesheets windowed to `submittedAt` ≥ 90 days back, users unwindowed); Staff gets only own data. Tasks + task completions listeners are shared by both roles (all active tasks; all completions in the shift date window — no per-user filter).
- **Key Collections**: `shifts`, `timesheets`, `users`, `messages`, `tasks`, `task_completions`, `settings` (doc `app`)
- **Write Operations**: Submit/resubmit timesheets, report absence, update profile, save availability, complete tasks, manager CRUD for shifts/timesheets

### API Layer (WorkerAPIClient)
- Authenticates with Firebase ID token (Bearer header)
- Base URL: `https://sura-roster.com`
- Endpoints: `POST /api/staff/availability`, `POST /api/complete-password-change`, `POST /api/send-notification`

---

## Firestore Collections

| Collection | Document ID | Used By | Key Fields |
|------------|-------------|---------|------------|
| `users` | Firebase UID | Both | fullName, email, role, status, employmentType, weeklyAvailability, mustChangePassword, needsSetup |
| `shifts` | Auto-generated | Both | staffId, date (yyyy-MM-dd), rosteredStart, rosteredEnd, breakMinutes, scheduledHours, status, location |
| `timesheets` | Auto-generated | Both | shiftId, staffId, actualStart, actualEnd, actualBreakMinutes, workedHours, status, managerNotes |
| `messages` | Auto-generated | Both | senderId, recipientId, body, sentAt, expiresAt, read |
| `tasks` | Auto-generated | Both | title, description, frequency, date, dayOfWeek, active, managerPhotoUrl |
| `task_completions` | `{taskId}_{date}` | Both | taskId, date, completed, completedAt, completedBy, staffPhotoUrl |
| `settings` | `app` | Both | companyName |

---

## Business Rules (from `BusinessRules.swift`)

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Break range | 0–90 minutes, step 5 |
| Shift window (staff view) | 28 days back, 56 days forward |
| Manager timesheet listener window | 90 days back (`managerTimesheetWindowDaysBack`) — keeps the all-staff live listener fast; staff keep own 5-year history |
| Availability edit range | -2 to +12 weeks from current |
| Week start | Monday |
| Timezone | Australia/Adelaide |
| Timesheet submittable | After shift end time (`submittableAfter` or computed from rostered end) |
| Password requirements | 8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 digit (a symbol is *recommended* in the UI checklist but not required — see `BusinessRules.passwordErrors`) |
| Staff can report absence | Before shift becomes submittable AND no approved timesheet exists |
| Staff can submit hours | After shift end AND shift is published AND no approved/absent timesheet |

---

## Behaviors To Know (undocumented elsewhere)

- **7-day forced manual login**: quick sign-in (Face ID / passkey) is refused if the last *manual* password login was more than 7 days ago (`roster_last_manual_login_date` in UserDefaults, checked in `LoginView`; also reset by `VerifyPasswordSheet`).
- **`AuthViewModel.temporaryPassword`**: the plaintext password is held in memory after a manual login so the Account tab can enable Face ID without re-prompting. It is cleared when Face ID is enabled or on logout.
- **Background re-lock**: with device auth enabled, returning from ≥2 minutes in the background re-requires biometric unlock (`AppConfig.deviceAuthBackgroundRelock`).
- **Timesheet doc id == shift id** for staff-created timesheets (1:1); manager operations reference `timesheet.id` directly.
- **Timesheet writes set `submittedAt` (server timestamp)** — the manager's 90-day windowed listener depends on this field existing on every timesheet.

---

## Design System

### Theme (`DesignSystem/Theme.swift`)
- Colors defined with light/dark variants using `Color(UIColor { traitCollection in ... })`
- Brand: indigo `#4F46E5` / `#6366F1`
- Accent: green `#10B981` / `#34D399`
- Surfaces: background, card, separator
- Text: primary, secondary, tertiary
- Status styles: pending (amber), approved (green), rejected (red), draft (gray), absent (purple)
- Corner radii: small (8), medium (12), large (16)
- Layout constants: `maxContentWidth` (1400), `minColumnWidth` (168)
- **Liquid Glass helpers (2026 UI)**: `glassSurface(in:tint:interactive:)`, `glassCapsule(tint:interactive:)`, `glassProminentSurface(in:tint:)`. Reserved for the navigation layer (bars, control clusters, floating buttons) — never content. Gated by `#if compiler(>=6.2)` + `if #available(iOS 26.0, *)`, with an `.ultraThinMaterial` fallback for iOS 17–25. The app deploys to iOS 17 but adopts real Liquid Glass automatically on iOS/iPadOS/macOS 26+.

### Reusable Components (`DesignSystem/Components/`)
| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `Buttons.swift` | PrimaryButtonStyle, SecondaryButtonStyle, InlinePillButtonStyle |
| `GlassCard.swift` | Card and GlassCard with optional accent stripe |
| `WeekSelector.swift` | 7-day week strip with navigation arrows |
| `StatusPill.swift` | Compact status badge with colored dot |
| `Banner.swift` | Info/warning/error/success inline banner |
| `Toast.swift` | Transient top-of-screen toast messages |
| `StatTile.swift` | Metric tile (value + label) |
| `Skeleton.swift` | Loading shimmer placeholders |
| `EmptyStateView.swift` | Empty state with icon + message + action |
| `SectionHeader.swift` | Section title with optional trailing view |
| `CameraPicker.swift` | Camera/photo library picker for task photos |
| `ScreenTitlePill.swift` | Navigation bar pill-shaped title |

## Current State & Known Limitations

### Working Features
- ✅ Staff login with email/password
- ✅ Biometric/passcode quick-login
- ✅ View rostered shifts with week navigation
- ✅ Submit/resubmit worked hours (timesheets)
- ✅ Report absence for shifts
- ✅ Weekly availability management
- ✅ Task completion with photo evidence
- ✅ View notification messages
- ✅ Timesheet history with filters
- ✅ Add shifts to iOS Calendar
- ✅ Manager dashboard with live metrics
- ✅ Manager roster management (create/edit/delete/publish shifts)
- ✅ Manager roster — adaptive iPad/Mac week-grid with 2026 Liquid Glass, drag move/copy (drafts only; published shifts locked), bulk delete by all-staff/per-staff with week-based visibility rules, dynamic week label, week-aware add-shift default date
- ✅ Manager timesheet approval/rejection — week-based single full-width view (week selector + glass status/staff filters + adaptive card grid + bottom summary), detail as a sheet; glass approve/reject
- ✅ Manager Staff directory (searchable, status filters). Detail edits are **per-field** — pencil to unlock, checkmark to save just that field via `repo.updateStaffFields(staffId:, [key:value])` (direct `users/{id}` write; needs manager-write Firestore rules). **Email = request-and-self-confirm**: manager taps "Ask {name} to change their email" → `repo.requestStaffEmailChange` sets `emailChangeRequired`; staff sees a banner in Account → `ChangeEmailView` (`verifyBeforeUpdateEmail`, Firebase link) → clears the flag. Also "require new address" → `repo.requestStaffAddressUpdate` → `ProfileCompletionView` gate (with Sign out).
- ✅ Manager Availability (week selector; staff × 7-day matrix on iPad/Mac, per-staff cards on iPhone)
- ✅ Manager Reports (weekly analytics: scheduled/worked hours, labour cost + super, timesheet status, per-staff breakdown)
- ✅ Device auth gate (biometric lock)
- ✅ Forced password change flow
- ✅ Profile completion flow

### Not Yet Implemented / Disabled
- ❌ Push notifications (waiting for paid Apple Developer account — see `docs/WHEN_DEVELOPER_ACCOUNT_READY.md`)
- ❌ Manager tasks management UI (uses placeholder view)
- ❌ Manager wage & tenure/hours views (placeholders)
- ❌ Passkey-based auth (code exists but not wired into main flow)

---

## File Naming Conventions

- Views: `{Feature}View.swift` (e.g., `RosterView.swift`, `ManagerDashboardView.swift`)
- Sheets/modals: `{Feature}Sheet.swift` (e.g., `SubmitHoursSheet.swift`, `DayEditSheet.swift`)
- Models: Named after the entity (e.g., `Shift.swift`, `User.swift`)
- Services: Named after the concern (e.g., `AuthService.swift`, `CalendarService.swift`)
- Manager views: Prefixed with `Manager` (e.g., `ManagerRosterView.swift`)

## How to Modify This Project

### Adding a New Staff Feature
1. Create view(s) in `Features/{FeatureName}/`
2. Add any new models to `Models/`
3. Add Firestore operations to `RosterRepository.swift`
4. Add tab/navigation in `Features/Shell/MainTabView.swift`
5. Update this `agents.md` file

### Adding a New Manager Feature
1. Create view(s) in `Features/Manager/{FeatureName}/`
2. Add tab case to `ManagerTab` enum in `Features/Manager/Shell/ManagerNavigation.swift`
3. Wire up in `Features/Manager/Shell/ManagerMainView.swift`
4. Add Firestore operations to `RosterRepository.swift` (uses role-based listeners)
5. Update this `agents.md` file

**2026 UI conventions for new manager tabs (match `ManagerRosterView`):**
- Drive layout from **measured container width** (via `GeometryReader`), not size class alone, so Split View / Slide Over / resized Mac windows behave. Reuse a compact layout below ~720pt.
- Center wide content at `Theme.maxContentWidth`; avoid horizontal scrolling for primary content.
- Apply **Liquid Glass** only to the navigation layer (bars, control clusters, floating buttons) using the `Theme` glass helpers (`glassCapsule`, `glassProminentSurface`, `glassSurface`); keep lists/cards solid.
- **Footer pills / summary bars: always use dark text** (`Theme.textPrimary`), never `textSecondary`/`textTertiary`. Glass/translucent footers wash out light text, so keep footer chip labels dark for legibility (see the Roster and Timesheets bottom summary bars). Prefer a **fixed footer** (in the layout `VStack`) over a translucent `.safeAreaInset` bar when content would otherwise scroll under and show through.
- **One sheet per view.** Do NOT attach multiple `.sheet` / `.sheet(item:)` modifiers to the same view — SwiftUI presents them unreliably (slow, or sometimes never until an app restart). Use a single `.sheet(item:)` driven by one `Identifiable` enum with a case per destination (see `ManagerRosterView.ActiveSheet` for create vs edit).
- Respect `accessibilityReduceMotion` for custom animations; add accessibility labels to icon-only buttons.
- New Swift files must be added to the Xcode target — this project uses **explicit file refs in `project.pbxproj`** (XcodeGen, no file-system sync). Either run `xcodegen generate` after adding files, or place shared helpers in an already-referenced file (that's why the glass helpers live in `Theme.swift`).

### Adding a New Firestore Collection
1. Define model struct in `Models/` with `init?(id:data:)` using `FS` helpers
2. Add listener in `RosterRepository.start(uid:)` with `onSnapshot`
3. Add `@Published`/stored property to `RosterRepository`
4. For manager (all-staff) listeners, **scope by a date window** where possible (see the shifts listener and `managerTimesheetWindowDaysBack`) to keep them fast as collections grow
5. Update this `agents.md` file

### Modifying Business Rules
1. All rules are centralized in `Models/BusinessRules.swift`
2. Constants at the top, computed functions below
3. The web app's `src/lib/utils.ts` should stay in sync

## AI Agent Instructions

When working on this project:

1. **Always read this file first** to understand the project structure
2. **Use the existing patterns** — don't introduce new architectures or libraries
3. **Follow the Theme** — use `Theme.brand`, `Theme.card`, etc. for all colors
4. **Use `FS` helpers** for Firestore document parsing (never force-cast)
5. **Add to `RosterRepository`** for any new data operations
6. **Keep timezone-aware** — always use `RosterCalendar` for date operations
7. **Update this file** when adding new features, models, or services
8. **Match existing naming** — `{Feature}View.swift`, `{Feature}Sheet.swift`
9. **iPad support** — views should work on both iPhone and iPad (use `UIDevice.current.userInterfaceIdiom` checks where layout differs)
10. **Accessibility** — use semantic labels, dynamic type support via the Theme text styles
